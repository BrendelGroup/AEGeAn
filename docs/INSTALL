AEGeAn: INSTALLATION

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------
In principle, AEGeAn should compile and run on any POSIX-compliant UNIX system
(Linux, Mac OS X, Cygwin), although in practice, it has only been tested on
Linux and Mac systems. Native Windows support is not anticipated any time soon.
The AEGeAn developer(s) have made an effort to minimize dependency on external
software, but compiling and installing does require a few prerequisites.

  * common UNIX tools for building software: specifically, GNU make (version
    3.80 or later) and a C compiler with OpenMP support (e.g. GCC 4.2 or higher)
  * GenomeTools library (see http://genometools.org/ for download and
    installation instructions)

While not a strict requirement, fully leveraging the graphics capabilities
provided by AEGeAn requires that the system also have an installation of the
Cairo graphics library (see the GenomeTools documentation). Also, this tutorial
assumes the user has the git version control system installed. If this is not
the case, simply download the source code manually from the Github website.


Compiling and installing
----------------------------------------
It is generally assumed that the user will follow standard Linux/UNIX procedures
when downloading, compiling, and installing the GenomeTools prerequisite. The
default install directory is /usr/local, which means that we assume the
GenomeTools binaries have been installed in /usr/local/bin and the shared
libraries have been installed in /usr/local/lib.

If this is the case, then the default installation procedure should work just
fine. From the directory containing the AEGeAn source code distribution, enter
the following commands.

    make
    make install # requires root access

If you have some reason to install GenomeTools in some other directory (e.g.
if you don't have permissions to modify /usr/local), this should not be a
problem for AEGeAn. You must simply tell AEGeAn where to find GenomeTools. For
example, if you installed GenomeTools in `/home/alice/local', then you must
indicate this fact when compiling AEGeAn.

The following make options are available if you encounter any problems during
installation or if you want to customize your installation.

  - 64bit=yes          if you want compile for a 64-bit architecture
  - cairo=no           if your system does not have Cairo graphics libraries
                       installed (you will not be able to generate graphics)
  - GT_INSTALL_DIR=?   if you did not install GenomeTools in /usr/local
  - prefix=?           to install AEGeAn in a directory other than
                       /usr/local (e.g. if you do not have admin privileges)

For example, if I need to install GenomeTools and AEGeAn in my home directory
/home/alice, then I could do something like this.

    test -d /home/alice/local/src || mkdir -p /home/alice/local/src

    cd /home/alice/local/src
    git clone https://github.com/genometools/genometools.git
    cd genometools
    make prefix=/home/alice/local 64bit=yes
    make prefix=/home/alice/local 64bit=yes install

    cd /home/alice/local/src
    git clone git://github.com/standage/AEGeAn.git
    cd AEGeAn
    make prefix=/home/alice/local GT_INSTALL_DIR=/home/alice/local
    make prefix=/home/alice/local GT_INSTALL_DIR=/home/alice/local install

Remember that if you install the GenomeTools library in a non-standard location,
you will need to make sure that the ParsEval program can find that library at
runtime. This can be done on a temporary basis using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environmental variable or on a permanent system-wide basis using the ldconfig
command.

Although the /usr/local directory is the standard install location for third
party libraries, on some distributions this directory is not pre-configured.
If you use the default install locations and still run into problems, make sure
that /usr/local/bin is in your path (using the 'export' or 'setenv' commands)
and that '/usr/local/lib' is in the LD path (using the 'ldconfig' command).
