AEGeAn Toolkit Version 0.11
===========================

v0.11.0
-------

The biggest change with version v0.11 is the updated API for locus parsing. The
new `AgnLocusStream` class replaces the old two-step procedure involving the
`AgnLocusStream` class followed by the `AgnIntervalLocusStream` class. All
locus-parsing settings such as the extension delta and inclusion of sequence
fragments can be controlled using the new `AgnLocusStream` API. I'm very happy
that the new locus parsing code is completely streaming, although if you want
to report iLoci for unannotated sequences this requires an additional step which
essentially loads all of the data into memory anyway. :-/

Other updates include the following.
  * With this release, all compiled programs are guaranteed to have a working
    `-v/--version` flag.
  * Improvements to version reporting. See #120.
  * Fixed long-standing issues with ParsEval HTML reports. See #119.
  * Various other improvements and fixes.
