AEGeAn Toolkit Version 0.9
==========================

v0.9.4
------

  - Version 0.9.4 is intended to be the final stable release of AEGeAn's initial
    development effort. Version 0.10 represents a significant effort to rewrite
    the core modules of the system to be more consistent and efficient. I do not
    expect to give any more attention to this branch, although I may implement
    bug fixes if someone can give me a good motivating use case (that can't be
    accomplished with a newer version).

v0.9.3
------

  - Git has been used to track AEGeAn development efforts from an early stage.
    Version 0.9.3 is my first attempt to formally apply Semantic Versioning and
    Github's release features.
