# Without piuser=--user, make will try to install fidibus under /usr/local and
# fail without elevated priviliges.
# With piuser=--user, fidibus will be installed as a user local package under
# ~/.local.
# Setting the prefix to ~/.local will also put the AEGeAn binaries into
# ~/.local/bin. Thus, you should be able to access all the AEGeAn code in an
# appropriate python environment after having set
#
# PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
#

make prefix=~/.local piuser=--user install
make prefix=~/.local piuser=--user uninstall

make clean
#... does not remove ~/LOCAL; probably a good thing!
